# Code Highlighting
Delicious ways to highlight your code:

## Midnight Snack
Up late and munching your way through a repo? Maybe pull out that [Midnight Snack](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1thkCHiAt-D-dQUOGVMifANgzHFVJeMgK2ji8onyBhPo/edit?usp=sharing)!

This uses [Google Material Design Colors](https://www.google.com/design/spec/style/color.html#color-color-palette) to create a late-night-friendly dark-background color scheme.

## Candy Shop
Been working out your coding muscles for awhile? Tired of the healthy default colors? Treat yourself to a visit to the [Candy Shop](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YPx-B8ligX4TMPPGOTrG8ynYSvU7dvr--X4iz730Y20/edit?usp=sharing)!

This uses [Google Material Design Colors](https://www.google.com/design/spec/style/color.html#color-color-palette) to create a [natural-reading](http://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/q/15142/41779)-friendly light-background color scheme.
